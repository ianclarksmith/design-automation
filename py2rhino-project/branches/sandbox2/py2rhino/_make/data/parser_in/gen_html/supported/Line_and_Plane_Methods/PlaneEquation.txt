PlaneEquation



PlaneEquation


Returns the equation of  a plane. The standard equation of a plane with a non-zero normal vector is as follows:

Ax + By + Cz + D = 0


Syntax


Rhino.PlaneEquation (arrPlane)


Parameters



arrPlane 

Required.  Array.  The plane. The elements of a plane array are as follows:


Element 

Description

0 

Required.  The plane's origin (3-D point).

1 

Required.  The plane's X axis direction (3-D vector).

2 

Required.  The plane's Y axis direction (3-D vector).

3 

Optional.  The plane's Z axis direction (3-D vector).



Returns



Array 

An array containing four numbers that represent the coefficients of the equation, if successful.

Null 

If not successful, or on error.


Example


Dim arrPlane, arrEquation

arrPlane = Rhino.ViewCPlane

arrEquation = Rhino.PlaneEquation

Rhino.Print "A = " & CStr(arrEquation(0))

Rhino.Print "B = " & CStr(arrEquation(1))

Rhino.Print "C = " & CStr(arrEquation(2))

Rhino.Print "D = " & CStr(arrEquation(3))
