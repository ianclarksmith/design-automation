IsObjectInBox



IsObjectInBox


Verifies an object's bounding box is inside of another bounding box.


Syntax


Rhino.IsObjectInBox (strObject, arrBox, [blnMode])


Parameters



strObject 

Required.  String.  The identifier of an object.

arrBox 

Required.  Array.  The bounding box to test against. A bounding box is an array of eight 3-D points that define the corners of the box.  Points need to be  in counter-clockwise order starting with the bottom rectangle of the box.

blnMode 

Optional.  Boolean.  The test mode.


Value 

Description

True (Default) 

The object's bounding box must be contained by the test bounding box. In other words, test.min <= object.min and object.max <= test.max.

False 

The object's bounding box must be contained by or intersect with the test bounding box.



Returns



True 

The object is hidden.

False 

The object is not hidden.

Null 

On error.


Example


Dim arrBox, arrObjects strObject

arrBox = Rhino.GetBox

If IsArray(arrBox) Then

  Rhino.EnableRedraw False

  arrObjects = Rhino.AllObjects

  For Each strObject In arrObjects

    If Rhino.IsObjectInBox(strObject, arrBox, False) Then

      Rhino.SelectObject strObject

    End If

  Next

  Rhino.EnableRedraw True

End If
