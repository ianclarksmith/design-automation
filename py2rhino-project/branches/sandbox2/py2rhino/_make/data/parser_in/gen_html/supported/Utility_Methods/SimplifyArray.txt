Flattens an array of 3-D points into a one-dimensional array of real number. For example, if you had an array containing three 3-D points, this method would return a one-dimensional array containing nine real numbers.


Syntax


Rhino.SimplifyArray (arrPoints)


Parameters



arrPoints 

Required. Array. An array of 3-D points.

If not successful or on error.


Example


Dim arrPoints, arrNumbers, n

arrPoints = Rhino.GetPoints

If IsArray(arrPoints) Then 

  arrNumbers = Rhino.SimplifyArray(arrPoints)

  For Each n In arrNumbers

    Rhino.Print n

  Next
