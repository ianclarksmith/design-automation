OrientObjects



OrientObjects


Orients one or more objects based on input points.


Syntax


Rhino.OrientObjects (arrObjects, arrReference, arrTarget [, intFlags])


Parameters



arrObjects 

Required.  Array.  An array of strings identifying the objects to orient.

arrReference 

Required.  Array.  An array of 3-D reference points.  If two 3-D points are specified, then this method will function similar to Rhino's Orient command.  If more than two 3-D points are specified, then the function will orient similar to Rhino's Orient3Pt command.

arrTarget 

Required.  Array.  An array of 3-D target points.  If two 3-D points are specified, then this method will function similar to Rhino's Orient command.  If more than two 3-D points are specified, then the function will orient similar to Rhino's Orient3Pt command.

intFlags 

Optional.  Number.  The orient flags.  Values can be added together to specify multiple options.


Value 

Description

1 

Copy object.  The default is not to copy the objects.

2 

Scale object.  The default is not to scale the objects.  Note, the scale option only applies if both arrReference and arrTarget contain only two 3-D points.



Returns



Array 

An array of strings identifying the oriented objects if successful.

Null 

If not successful, or on error.


Example


Dim arrObjects, arrReference, arrTarget

arrObjects = Rhino.GetObjects("Select objects to orient")

If IsArray(arrObjects) Then

arrReference = Rhino.GetPoints(,,"First reference point")

If IsArray(arrReference) And (UBound(arrReference) > 0) Then

arrTarget = Rhino.GetPoints(,,"First target point")

If IsArray(arrTarget) And (UBound(arrTarget) > 0) Then

Rhino.OrientObjects arrObjects, arrReference, arrTarget

End If

End If

End If
