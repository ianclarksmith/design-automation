CurveDirectionsMatch



CurveDirectionsMatch


Tests if two curve objects are generally in the same direction or if they would be more in the same direction if one of them were flipped. When testing curve directions, both curves must be either open or closed - you cannot test one open curve and one closed curve.


Syntax


Rhino.CurveDirectionsMatch (strCurve1, strCurve2)


Parameters



strCurve1 

Required. String. The identifier of the first curve to compare.

strCurve2 

Required. String. The identifier of the second curve to compare.


Returns



Boolean 

True if the curve directions match, otherwise False.

Null 

On error.


Example


Dim strCurve1, strCurve2, blnCompare

strCurve1 = Rhino.GetObject("Select first curve to compare", 4)

strCurve2 = Rhino.GetObject("Select second curve to compare", 4)

blnCompare = Rhino.CurveDirectionsMatch(strCurve1, strCurve2)

If blnCompare = True Then

  Rhino.Print "Curves are in the same direction"

Else

  Rhino.Print "Curve are not in the same direction"

End If
