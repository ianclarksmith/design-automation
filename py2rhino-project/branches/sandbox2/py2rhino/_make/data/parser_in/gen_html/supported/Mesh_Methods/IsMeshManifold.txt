IsMeshManifold


Verifies a mesh object is manifold.  A mesh for which every edge is shared by at most two faces is called a manifold.  If a mesh has at least one edge that is shared by more than two faces, then that mesh is called non-manifold.


Syntax


Rhino.IsMeshManifold (strObject)


Parameters



strObject 

Required.  String.  The object's identifier.


Returns



Boolean 

True if successful, otherwise False.

Null 

On error.


Example


Const rhObjectMesh = 32

Dim strObject

strObject = Rhino.GetObject("Select a mesh", rhObjectMesh)

If Rhino.IsMeshClosed(strObject) Then

Rhino.Print "The mesh is manifold."

Else

Rhino.Print "The mesh is non-manifold."

End If
