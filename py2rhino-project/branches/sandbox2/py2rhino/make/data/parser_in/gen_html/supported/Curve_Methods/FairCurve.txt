FairCurve



FairCurve


Fairs a curve object. Fair works best on degree 3 (cubic) curves. Fair attempts to remove large curvature variations while limiting the geometry changes to be no more than the specified tolerance. Sometimes several applications of this method are necessary to remove nasty curvature problems.


Syntax


Rhino.FairCurve (strObject [, dblTolerance])


Parameters



strObject 

Required.  String.  The object's identifier.

dblTolerance 

Optional.  Number.  The fairing tolerance. Of omitted, a default value of 1.0 is used.


Returns



Boolean 

True or False indicating success or failure.

Null 

On error.


Example


Const rhObjectCurve = 4

Dim arrCurves, strCurve

arrCurves = Rhino.GetObjects("Select curves to fair", rhObjectCurve)

If IsArray(arrCurves) Then

  For Each strCurve In arrCurves

    Rhino.FairCurve strCurve

  Next

End If
