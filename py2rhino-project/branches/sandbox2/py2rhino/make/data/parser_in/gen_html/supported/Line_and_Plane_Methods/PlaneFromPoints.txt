PlaneFromPoints



PlaneFromPoints


Creates a plane from three non-colinear points.


Syntax


Rhino.PlaneFromPoints (arrOrigin, arrPointX, arrPointY)


Parameters



arrOrigin 

Required.  Array.  The first point, or origin, of the plane.

arrPointX 

Required.  Array.  A point on the plane's X axis.

arrPointY 

Required.  Array.  A point on the plane's Y axis.


Returns



Array 

The plane if successful.  The elements of a plane array are as follows:


Element 

Description

0 

The plane's origin (3-D point).

1 

The plane's X axis direction (3-D vector).

2 

The plane's Y axis direction (3-D vector).

3 

The plane's Z axis direction (3-D vector).


Null 

If not successful, or on error.


Example


Dim arrCorners

arrCorners = Rhino.GetRectangle

If IsArray(arrCorners) Then

  Rhino.ViewCPlane , Rhino.PlaneFromPoints(arrCorners(0), arrCorners(1), arrCorners(3))

End If
