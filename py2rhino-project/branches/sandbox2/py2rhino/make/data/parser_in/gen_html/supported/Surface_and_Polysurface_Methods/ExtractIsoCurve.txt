ExtractIsoCurve



ExtractIsoCurve


Extracts isoparametric curves from a surface.


Syntax


Rhino.ExtractIsoCurve (strObject , arrParameter, intDir)


Parameters



Parameters



strObject 

Required.  String.  The object's identifier.

arrParameter 

Required.  Array.  An array containing the U,V parameter of the surface to evaluate.

intDir 

Required.  Number.  The direction, either 0 = U, 1 = V, or 2 = Both.


Returns



Array 

An array of strings identifying the newly created curve objects if successful.

Null 

If not successful, or on error.


Example


Const rhObjectSurface = 8

Dim strObject, arrPoint, arrParameter

strObject = Rhino.GetObject("Select surface for isocurve extraction", rhObjectSurface)

arrPoint = Rhino.GetPointOnSurface(strObject, "Select location for extraction")

arrParameter = Rhino.SurfaceClosestPoint(strObject, arrPoint)

Rhino.ExtractIsoCurve strObject, arrParameter , 2
