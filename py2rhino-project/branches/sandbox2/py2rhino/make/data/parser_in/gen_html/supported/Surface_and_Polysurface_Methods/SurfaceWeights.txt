SurfaceWeights



SurfaceWeights


Returns an array of weight values that are assigned to the control points of a surface.  The number of weights returned will be equal to the number of control points in the U and V directions.


Syntax


Rhino.SurfaceWeights (strObject)


Parameters



strObject 

Required.  String.  The object's identifier.


Returns



Array 

The weight values of the surface if successful.

Null 

If not successful, or on error.


Example


Dim strObject, arrCount, arrWeights, intCount

strObject = Rhino.GetObject("Select a surface")

If Rhino.IsSurface(strObject) Then

arrWeights = Rhino.SurfaceWeights(strObject)

If IsArray(arrWeights) Then

arrCount = Rhino.SurfacePointCount(strObject)

intCount = 0

For u = 0 To arrCount(0) - 1

For v = 0 To arrCount(1) - 1

Rhino.Print "Surface control point weight value: " & arrWeights(intCount)

intCount = intCount + 1
