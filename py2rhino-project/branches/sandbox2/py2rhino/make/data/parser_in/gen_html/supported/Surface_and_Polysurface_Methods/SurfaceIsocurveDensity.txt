SurfaceIsocurveDensity


Returns or sets the isocurve density of a surface or polysurface object. An isoparametric curve is a curve of constant U or V value on a surface. Rhino uses isocurves and surface edge curves to visualize the shape of a NURBS surface.


Syntax


Rhino.SurfaceIsocurveDensity (strObject [, intDensity])


Parameters



strObject 

Required.  String.  The object's identifier.

intDensity 

Optional.  Number.  The isocurve wireframe density.  The possible values are as follows:


Value 

Description

-1 

Hides surface isocurves.

0         

Display boundary and knot wires.

1 

Display boundary and knot wires and one interior wire if there are no interior knots.

>= 2 

Display boundary and knot wires and (N+1) interior wires.



Returns



Number 

The intDensity is not specified, then the current isocurve density if successful.

Number 

The intDensity is specified, then the previous isocurve density if successful.

Null 

If not successful, or on error.


Example


Const rhObjectSurface = 8

Const rhObjectPolySurface = 16

Dim strObject

strObject = Rhino.GetObject("Select a surface", rhObjectSurface + rhObjectPolySurface)

If Not IsNull(strObject) Then

Rhino.SurfaceIsocurveDensity strObject, 8

End If
