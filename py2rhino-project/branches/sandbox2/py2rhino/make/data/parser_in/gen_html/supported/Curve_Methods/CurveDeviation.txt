CurveDeviation



CurveDeviation


Returns the minimum and maximum deviation between two curve objects. For more information on curve deviation, see the Rhino help file for the CrvDeviation command.


Syntax


Rhino.CurveDeviation (strCurveA, strCurveB)


Parameters



strCurveA 

Required.  String.  The identifier of the first curve object.

strCurveB 

Required.  String.  The identifier of the second curve object.


Returns



Array 

An array of numbers identifying the minimum and maximum deviation between the two curves if successful.

Type 

Description

0 

Number 

Curve A parameter at maximum overlap distance point

1 

Number 

Curve A parameter at maximum overlap distance point

2 

Number 

Maximum overlap distance

3 

Number 

Curve A parameter at minimum distance point

4 

Number 

Curve B parameter at minimum distance point

5 

Number 

Minimum distance between curves


Null 

On error or if no intervals of overlap were found.


Example


Dim strCurveA, strCurveB, arrDeviation

strCurveA = Rhino.GetObject("Select first curve to test", 4)

strCurveB = Rhino.GetObject("Select second curve to test", 4)

arrDeviation = Rhino.CurveDeviation(strCurveA, strCurveB)

If IsArray(arrDeviation) Then

  Rhino.Print "Minimum deviation = " & CStr(arrDeviation(5))

  Rhino.Print "Maximum deviation = " & CStr(arrDeviation(2))

End If
