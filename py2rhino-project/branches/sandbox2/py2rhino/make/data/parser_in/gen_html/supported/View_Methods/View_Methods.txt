View and Viewport Methods


The following methods provide access to Rhino's views and viewports. As the lines between what in Rhino is related to a "view" and what is related to a "viewport" can appear to be blurred, everything view or viewport related in RhinoScript is simply referred to as "view."

The majority of view-related methods require that you specify the name, or title, of the view that you want to query or modify. You can obtain a list of view names by using the ViewNames method. Because it is possible for a document to have two views with the same title, you can also specify a view by its identifier, or UUID. The ViewNames method will return a list of view identifiers if you specify the option bReturnNames argument as False.
