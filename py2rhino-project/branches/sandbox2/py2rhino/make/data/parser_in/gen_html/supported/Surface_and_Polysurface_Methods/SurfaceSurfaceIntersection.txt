SurfaceSurfaceIntersection



SurfaceSurfaceIntersection


Calculates the intersection of a surface object with another surface object. Note, this function works on untrimmed surfaces.


Syntax


Rhino.SurfaceSurfaceIntersection (strSurfaceA, strSurfaceB [, dblTolerance [, blnCreate]])


Parameters



strSurfaceA 

Required.  String.  The identifier of the first surface object.

strSurfaceB 

Required.  String.  The identifier of the second surface object.

dblTolerance 

Optional.  Number.  The absolute tolerance in drawing units.  If omitted, the document's current absolute tolerance is used.

blnCreate 

Optional.  Boolean.  Create the intersection curves and points.  If omitted, intersection geometry will not be created.


Returns



Array 

If blnCreate is not specified or is equal to False, an array numbers identifying the intersection event type if successful.  The array will contain one or more of the following intersection event types:


Type 

Description

1 

Transverse surface-surface intersection curve.

2 

Tangent surface-surface intersection curve.

3 

Overlap surface-surface intersection curve.

4 

Transverse surface-surface intersection point.

5 

Tangent surface-surface intersection point.


Array 

If blnCreate is specified and is equal to True, a two-dimensional array of intersection information if successful.  The array will contain one or more of the following elements:


Element 

Type 

Description

(n, 0) 

Number 

The intersection event type.  See the above table for details.

(n, 1) 

String 

The identifier of the intersection curve or point object that was created.


Null 

If not successful, or on error.


Example


Sub SSX()

Const rhObjectSurface = 8

Dim strSurfaceA, strSurfaceB, arrSSX

strSurfaceA = Rhino.GetObject("Select first surface", rhObjectSurface)

If IsNull(strSurfaceA) Or Rhino.IsSurface(strSurfaceA) = False Then Exit Sub

strSurfaceB = Rhino.GetObject("Select second surface", rhObjectSurface)

If IsNull(strSurfaceB) Or Rhino.IsSurface(strSurfaceB) = False Then Exit Sub

arrSSX = Rhino.SurfaceSurfaceIntersection(strSurfaceA, strSurfaceB,, True)

If Not IsArray(arrSSX) Then

Rhino.Print "Surfaces do not intersect."

Exit Sub

End If

For i = 0 to UBound(arrSSX)

Select Case arrSSX(i,0)

Case 1 Rhino.Print "Transverse surface-surface intersection curve."

Case 2 Rhino.Print "Tangent surface-surface intersection curve."

Case 3 Rhino.Print "Overlap surface-surface intersection curve."

Case 4 Rhino.Print "Transverse surface-surface intersection point."

Case 5 Rhino.Print "Tangent surface-surface intersection point."

End Select

Rhino.SelectObject arrSSX(i,1)

Next

End Sub
