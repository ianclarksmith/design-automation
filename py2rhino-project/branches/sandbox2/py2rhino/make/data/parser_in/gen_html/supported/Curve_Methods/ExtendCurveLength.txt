ExtendCurveLength



ExtendCurveLength


Extends a non-closed curve object by a line, arc, or smooth extension for a specified distance.


Syntax


Rhino.ExtendCurveLength (strObject, intType, intSide, dblLength)


Parameters



strObject 

Required.  String.  The object's identifier.

intType 

Required.  Number.  Type of extension.


Value 

Description

0 

Line - Creates an line extension tangent to the original curve.

1 

Arc - Creates an arc extension tangent to the original curve.

2 

Smooth - Creates a smooth curve extension curvature continuous with the original curve.


intSide 

Required.  Number.  The size to  extent.


Value 

Description

0 

Extend from the start of the curve.

1 

Extend from the end of the curve.

2 

Extend from both the start and the end of the curve.


dblLength 

Required.  Number.  The distance to extend the curve.


Returns



String 

The identifier of the extended object if successful.

Null 

If not successful, or on error.


Example


Const rhObjectCurve = 4

Dim strCurve, dblLength

strCurve = Rhino.GetObject("Select curve to extend", rhObjectCurve)

If Not IsNull(strCurve) Then

dblLength = 3.0

dblLength = Rhino.GetReal("Length to extend", dblLength)

If IsNumeric(dblLength) Then

Rhino.ExtendCurveLength strCurve, 2, 2, dblLength

End If

End If
