ObjectMaterialIndex



ObjectMaterialIndex


Returns the material index of an object.

Rendering materials are stored in Rhino's rendering material table.  This table is conceptually an array.  Render materials associated with objects and layers are specified by zero based indices into this array.

If the return value of ObjectMaterialSource is "material by object", then the return value of this function is the index of the object's rendering material.  A material index of -1 indicates no material has been assigned, and that Rhino's internal default material has been assigned to the object.


Syntax


Rhino.ObjectMaterialIndex (strObject)


Parameters



strObject 

Required.  String.  The identifier of the object.


Returns



Number 

The rendering material index if successful.

Null 

If not successful, or on error.


Example


Dim strObject, intSource, intIndex

strObject = Rhino.GetObject("Select object")

If Not IsNull(strObject) Then

intSource = Rhino.ObjectMaterialSource(strObject)

If (intSource = 0) Then

Rhino.Print "The material source is by layer"

Else

Rhino.Print "The material source is by object"

intIndex = Rhino.ObjectMaterialIndex(strObject)

If (intIndex = -1) Then

Rhino.Print "The material is default."

Else

Rhino.Print "The material is custom."

End If

End If

End If
