Polar



Polar


Returns the 3-D point that is a specified angle and distance from a 3-D point.


Syntax


Rhino.Polar (arrPoint, dblAngle, dblDistance [, arrPlane])


Parameters



arrPoint 

Required.  Array.  The 3-D point to transform.

dblAngle 

Required.  Number.  The angle in degrees.

dblDistance 

Required.  Number.  The distance.

arrPlane 

Optional.  Array.  The plane to base the transformation. Of omitted, the world x-y plane is used. The elements of a plane array are as follows:


0 

Required.  The plane's origin (3-D point).

1 

Required.  The plane's X axis direction (3-D vector).

2 

Required.  The plane's Y axis direction (3-D vector).

3 

Optional.  The plane's Z axis direction (3-D vector).



Returns



Array 

The resulting 3-D point if successful.

Null 

On error.


Example


Dim arrPoint, arrResult

arrPoint = Array(1.0, 1.0, 0.0)

arrResult = Rhino.Polar(arrPoint, 45.0, 1.414214)

Rhino.Print Rhino.Pt2Str(arrResult)
