Geometry Methods


The following methods are available for creating, querying or manipulating miscellaneous geometric objects.  For methods relating to curve objects, see Curve Methods.  For methods relating to surface and polysurface objects, see Surface and Polysurface Methods.  For methods relating to mesh objects, see Mesh Methods.
