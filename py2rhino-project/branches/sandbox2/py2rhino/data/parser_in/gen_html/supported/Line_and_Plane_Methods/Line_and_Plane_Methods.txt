Line and Plane Methods



Plane Methods


The following methods are available for creating and manipulating lines and planes.

Lines are represented as zero-based, one-dimensional arrays containing two elements: the start point (3-D point) and the end point (3-D point).

Planes are represented as zero-based, one-dimensional arrays containing four elements: the plane's origin (3-D point), the plane's x-axis direction (3-D vector), the plane's y-axis direction (3-D vector), and the plane's z-axis direction (3-D vector).
