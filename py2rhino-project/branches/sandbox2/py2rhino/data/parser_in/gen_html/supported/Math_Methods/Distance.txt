Distance



Distance


Measures the distance between two 3-D points, or between a 3-D point and an array of 3-D points.


Syntax


Rhino.Distance (arrPoint1, arrPoint2)

Rhino.Distance (arrPoint1, arrPointArray)


Parameters



arrPoint1 

Required.  Array.  The first 3-D point.

arrPoint2 

Required.  Array.  The second 3-D point.

arrPointArray 

Required.  Array.  An array of 3-D points.


Returns



Number 

If arrPoint1 and arrPoint2 are specified, then the distance is successful.

Array 

If arrPoint1 and arrPointArray are specified, then an array of distances if successful.

Null 

If not successful, or on error.


Example


Dim arrPoint1, arrPoint2, dblDistance

arrPoint1 = Rhino.GetPoint("First point")

If IsArray(arrPoint1) Then

arrPoint2 = Rhino.GetPoint("Second point")

If IsArray(arrPoint2) Then

dblDistance = Rhino.Distance(arrPoint1, arrPoint2)

If Not IsNull(dblDistance) Then

Rhino.Print "Distance: " & CStr(dblDistance)

End If

End If

End If
