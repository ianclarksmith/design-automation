GetPointCoordinates



GetPointCoordinates


Prompts the user to pick or select one or more point objects. Unlike GetObjects, this function does not return an array of point object identifiers. Rather, it returns an array of 3-D point coordinates - one for each selected point object. Note, the array returned is not in any sorted order.


Syntax


Rhino.GetPointCoordinates ([strMessage [, blnPreSelect]])


Parameters



strMessage 

Optional.  String.  A prompt or message.

blnPreSelect 

Optional.  Boolean.  Allow for the selection of pre-selected objects.  If omitted, pre-selected objects are not accepted (False).


Returns



Array 

An array of 3-D points, one for each selected point object, if successful.

Null 

If not successful, or on error.


Example


Dim arrPoints, arrPt

arrPoints = Rhino.GetPointCoordinates

If IsArray(arrPoints) Then

  For Each arrPt in arrPoints

    Rhino.Print Rhino.Pt2Str(arrPt)

  Next

End If
