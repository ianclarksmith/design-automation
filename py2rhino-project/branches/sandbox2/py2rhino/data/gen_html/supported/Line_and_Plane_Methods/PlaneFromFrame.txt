PlaneFromFrame



PlaneFromFrame


Construct a plane from a point, and two vectors in the plane.


Syntax


Rhino.PlaneFromFrame (arrOrigin, arrXaxis, arrYaxis)


Parameters



arrOrigin 

Required.  Array.  A 3-D point identifying the origin of the plane.

arrXaxis 

Required.  Array.  A non-zero 3-D vector in the plane that determines the X axis direction.

arrYaxis 

Required.  Array.  A non-zero 3-D vector not parallel to arrXaxis that is used to determine the Y axis direction. Note, arrYaxis does not have to be perpendicular to arrXaxis.


Returns



Array 

The plane if successful.  The elements of a plane array are as follows:


Element 

Description

0 

The plane's origin (3-D point).

1 

The plane's X axis direction (3-D vector).

2 

The plane's Y axis direction (3-D vector).

3 

The plane's Z axis direction (3-D vector).


Null 

If not successful, or on error.


Example


Dim arrOrigin, arrXaxis, arrYaxis

arrOrigin = Rhino.GetPoint("CPlane origin")

If IsArray(arrOrigin) Then

  arrXaxis = Array(1,0,0)

  arrYaxis = Array(0,0,1)

  Rhino.ViewCPlane , Rhino.PlaneFromFrame(arrOrigin, arrXaxis, arrYaxis)

End If
