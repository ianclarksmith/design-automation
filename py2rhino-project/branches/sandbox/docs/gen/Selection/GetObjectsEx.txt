    intType
    Optional.  Number.  The type(s) of geometry objects (points, curves, surfaces, meshes, etc.) that can be selected.  Object types can be added together to filter several different kinds of geometry.

    blnGroup
    Optional.  Boolean.  Honor object grouping.  If omitted and the user picks a group, the entire group will be picked (True). Note, if intType is set to a value other than 0 (All objects), then group selection will be disabled.
    blnPreSelect
    Optional.  Boolean.  Allow for the selection of pre-selected objects.  If omitted, pre-selected objects are not accepted (False).
    blnSelect
    Optional.  Boolean.  Specifies whether or not the picked objects will remain selected when the function ends.  If omitted, objects that were pre-picked will remain selected and the objects that were post-picked will not be selected.
    arrObjects
    Optional.  Array.  An array of strings identifying the objects that are allowed to be selected.

[Returns]

    Array
    An array that contains arrays of selection information if successful. The array of selection information will contain the following:
    Element
    Description
    0
    String. The identifier of the object.
    1
    Boolean. True if the object was pre-selected, otherwise False.
    2
    Number. The selection method:
    0: selected by non-mouse method (SelAll, etc.).
    1: selected by mouse click on the object.
    2: selected by being inside of a mouse window.
    3: selected by intersecting a mouse crossing window.
    3
    Array. The selection point. This value is valid only if the object was not pre-selected and it was selected by clicking the mouse on the curve.
    4
    String. The name of the view in which the selection was made.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Dim arrObjects, arrObj
    arrObjects = Rhino.GetObjectsEx("Select object", 0, True)
    If IsArray(arrObjects) Then
    For Each arrObj In arrObjects
    Rhino.Print "Object id = " & arrObj(0)
    Rhino.Print "Object was preselected = " & CStr(arrObj(1))
    Select Case arrObj(2)
    Case 0
    Rhino.Print "Selection method = 0 (non-mouse)"
    Case 1
    Rhino.Print "Selection method = 1 (mouse)"
    Rhino.Print "Pick point = " & Rhino.Pt2Str(arrObj(3))
    Case 2
    Rhino.Print "Selection method = 1 (window)"
    Case 3
    Rhino.Print "Selection method = 1 (crossing)"
    End Select
    Rhino.Print "Active view = " & CStr(arrObj(4))
    Next
    End If
