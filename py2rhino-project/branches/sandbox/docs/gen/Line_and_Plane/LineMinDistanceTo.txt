[LineMinDistanceTo]

    Finds the shortest distance between the line, as a finite chord, and a point or another line.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.LineMinDistanceTo (arrLine, arrPoint)
    Rhino.LineMinDistanceTo (arrLine, arrLine2)

[Parameters]

    arrLine
    Required.  Array.  Two 3-D points identifying the starting and ending points of the line.
    arrPoint
    Required.  Array.  The test point.
    arrLine2
    Required.  Array.  Two 3-D points identifying the starting and ending points of the test line (another finite chord).

[Returns]

    Boolean
    A distance (D) such that if Q is any point on the line and P is any point on the other object, then D <= Rhino.Distance(Q, P).
    Null
    On error.

[Example]

    Dim arrFrom, arrTo, arrPoint, arrResult
    arrFrom = Array(0, 0, 0)
    arrTo = Array(10, 10, 0)
    arrPoint = Array(10, 5, 0)
    MsgBox Rhino.LineMinDistanceTo(Array(arrFrom, arrTo), arrPoint)
