[ProjectCurveToSurface]

    Projects one or more points onto one or more surfaces or polysurfaces.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.ProjectCurveToSurface (strCurve, strSurface, arrDirection)
    Rhino.ProjectCurveToSurface (strCurve, arrSurfaces, arrDirection)
    Rhino.ProjectCurveToSurface (arrCurves, strSurface, arrDirection)
    Rhino.ProjectCurveToSurface (arrCurves, arrSurfaces, arrDirection)

[Parameters]

    strCurve
    Required.  Array.  The identifier of a curve object to project.
    arrCurves
    Required.  Array.  The identifiers of one or more curve objects to project.
    strSurface
    Required.  String.  The identifier of the surface or polysurface object to project onto.
    arrSurfaces
    Required.  Array.  The identifiers of the surface or polysurface objects to project onto.
    arrDirection
    Required.  Array.  The direction (3-D vector) to project the points.

[Returns]

    Array
    The identifiers of the newly created, projected curve objects, if successful.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Sub TestProjectCurve
    Dim strCurve, strSurface
    strSurface = Rhino.GetObject("Select surface to project onto", 8)
    strCurve= Rhino.GetObject("Select curve to project", 4)
    ' Project down...
    Dim arrResults
    arrResults = Rhino.ProjectCurveToSurface(strCurve, strSurface, Array(0,0,-1))
    End Sub
