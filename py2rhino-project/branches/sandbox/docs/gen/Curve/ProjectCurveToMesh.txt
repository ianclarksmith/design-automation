[ProjectCurveToMesh]

    Projects one or more points onto one or more meshes.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.ProjectCurveToMesh (strCurve, strMesh, arrDirection)
    Rhino.ProjectCurveToMesh (strCurve, arrMeshes, arrDirection)
    Rhino.ProjectCurveToMesh (arrCurves, strMesh, arrDirection)
    Rhino.ProjectCurveToMesh (arrCurves, arrMeshes, arrDirection)

[Parameters]

    strCurve
    Required.  Array.  The identifier of a curve object to project.
    arrCurves
    Required.  Array.  The identifiers of one or more curve objects to project.
    strMesh
    Required.  String.  The identifier of the mesh object to project onto.
    arrMeshes
    Required.  Array.  The identifiers of the mesh objects to project onto.
    arrDirection
    Required.  Array.  The direction (3-D vector) to project the points.

[Returns]

    Array
    The identifiers of the newly created, projected curve objects, if successful.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Sub TestProjectCurve
    Dim strCurve, strMesh
    strMesh = Rhino.GetObject("Select mesh to project onto", 32)
    strCurve= Rhino.GetObject("Select curve to project", 4)
    ' Project down...
    Dim arrResults
    arrResults = Rhino.ProjectCurveToMesh(strCurve, strMesh, Array(0,0,-1))
    End Sub
