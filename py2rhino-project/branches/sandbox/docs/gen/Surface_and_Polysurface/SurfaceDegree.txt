[SurfaceDegree]

    Returns the degree of a  surface object in the specified direction.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.SurfaceDegree (strObject [, intDirection])

[Parameters]

    strObject
    Required.  String.  The object's identifier.
    intDirection
    Optional.  Number.  The direction, either 0 = U, or 1 = V, or 2 = Both.  Of omitted, both the degrees in the U and V directions are returned (2 = Both).

[Returns]

    Array
    If intDirection is not specified, or intDirection is set to 2, then the degree in both the U and V directions is returned.
    Number
    If intDirection is specified, and intDirection is set to either 0 or 1, then the degree in either the U or V direction is returned.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Const rhObjectSurface = 8
    Dim strObject
    strObject = Rhino.GetObject("Select a surface", rhObjectSurface)
    If Rhino.IsSurface(strObject) Then
    Rhino.Print "Degree in U direction: " & CStr(Rhino.SurfaceDegree(strObject, 0))
    Rhino.Print "Degree in V direction: " & CStr(Rhino.SurfaceDegree(strObject, 1))
    End If
