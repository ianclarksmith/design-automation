[BooleanDifference]

    Performs a Boolean difference operation on two sets of input surfaces and polysurfaces. For more details, see the BooleanDifference command in the Rhino help file.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.BooleanDifference (arrInput0, arrInput1 [, blnDelete])

[Parameters]

    arrInput0
    Required.  Array.  The identifiers of the surfaces or polysurfaces to subtract from.
    arrInput1
    Required.  Array.  The identifiers of the surfaces or polysurfaces to be subtracted.
    blnDelete
    Optional.  Boolean. Delete all input objects. The default is to delete all input objects (True).

[Returns]

    Array
    An array containing the identifiers of the newly created objects, if successful.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Const rhObjectSurface = 8
    Const rhObjectPolysurface = 16
    Dim arrInput0, arrInput1
    arrInput0 = Rhino.GetObjects("Select first set of surfaces or polysurfaces", rhObjectSurface + rhObjectPolysurface)
    If IsArray(arrInput0) Then
    arrInput1 = Rhino.GetObjects("Select second set of surfaces or polysurfaces", rhObjectSurface + rhObjectPolysurface)
    If IsArray(arrInput1) Then
    Rhino.BooleanDifference arrInput0, arrInput1
    End If
    End If
