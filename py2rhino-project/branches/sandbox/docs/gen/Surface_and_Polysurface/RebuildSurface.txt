[RebuildSurface]

    Rebuilds a surface to given degree and control point count.  For more information, see the Rhino help file for the Rebuild command.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.RebuildSurface (strObject [, arrDegree [, arrPointCount]])

[Parameters]

    strObject
    Required.  String.  The object's identifier.
    arrDegree
    Optional.  Array.  An array of two numbers that identify the surface curve degree in both the U and the V directions. Each degree value must be greater than 1. The default is 3 in each direction.
    arrPointCount
    Optional.  Array.  An array of two numbers that identify the surface point count in both the U and the V directions.  The point count must be greater than the degree.  The default value is 10 in each direction.

[Returns]

    Boolean
    True or False indicating success or failure.
    Null
    On error.

[Example]

    Const rhSurface = 8
    Dim strSrf
    strSrf = Rhino.GetObject("Select surface to rebuild", rhSurface)
    If Not IsNull(strSrf) Then
    Rhino.RebuildSurface strSrf, Array(3,3), Array(10,10)
    End If
