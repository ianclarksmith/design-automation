[ShortPath]

    Creates the shortest possible curve (geodesic) between two points on a surface. For more details, see the ShortPath command in the Rhino help file.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.ShortPath (strSurface, arrStart, arrEnd)

[Parameters]

    strSurface
    Required.  String.  The identifier of the surface object that pulls.
    arrStart
    Required.  Array.  A 3-D surface point identifying the starting point of the short curve.
    arrEnd
    Required.  Array.  A 3-D surface point identifying the ending point of the short curve.

[Returns]

    String
    The identifier of the new curve object if successful.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Const rhObjectSurface = 8
    Const rhObjectPolysurface = 16
    Dim strSurface, arrStart, arrEnd
    strSurface = Rhino.GetObject("Select surface for short path", rhObjectSurface + rhObjectPolysurface)
    If Not IsNull(strSurface) Then
    arrStart = Rhino.GetPointOnSurface(strSurface, "First point")
    arrEnd = Rhino.GetPointOnSurface(strSurface, "Second point")
    Rhino.ShortPath strSurface, arrStart, arrEnd
    End If
