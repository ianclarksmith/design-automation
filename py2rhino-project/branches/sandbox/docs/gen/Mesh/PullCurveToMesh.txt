[PullCurveToMesh]

    Pulls a curve object to a mesh object. The function makes a polyline approximation of the input curve and gets the closest point on the mesh for each point on the mesh.  Then it "connects the points" so  that you have a polyline on the mesh.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.PullCurveToMesh (strMesh, strCurve)

[Parameters]

    strMesh
    Required.  String.  The identifier of the mesh object that pulls.
    strCurve
    Required.  String.  The identifier of the curve object to pull.

[Returns]

    String
    The identifier of the new curve object if successful.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Const rhObjectCurve = 4
    Const rhObjectMesh = 32
    Dim strMesh, strCurve
    strMesh = Rhino.GetObject("Select mesh that pulls", rhObjectMesh)
    strCurve = Rhino.GetObject("Select curve to pull", rhObjectCurve)
    Rhino.PullCurveToMesh strMesh, strCurve
