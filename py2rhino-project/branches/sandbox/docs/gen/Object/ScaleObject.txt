[ScaleObject]

    Scales a single object. This function can be used to perform uniform or non-uniform scale transformations. Scaling is based on the active construction plane.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.ScaleObject (strObject, arrOrigin, arrScale [, blnCopy])

[Parameters]

    strObject
    Required. String. The identifier of the object to scale.
    arrOrigin
    Required. Array. The origin of the scale transformation.
    arrScale
    Required. Array. An array of three numbers that identify the X axis, Y axis, and Z axis scale factors to apply. Scaling is based on the active construction plane.
    blnCopy
    Optional. Boolean. Copy the object. If omitted, the object will not be copied (False).

[Returns]

    String
    The identifier of the scaled object if successful.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Dim strObject, arrOrigin
    strObject = Rhino.GetObject("Select object to scale")
    If Not IsNull(strObject) Then
    arrOrigin = Rhino.GetPoint("Origin point")
    If IsArray(arrOrigin) Then
    Rhino.ScaleObject strObject, arrOrigin, array(1,2,3), True
    End If
    End If
