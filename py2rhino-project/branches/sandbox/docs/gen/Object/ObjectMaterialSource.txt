[ObjectMaterialSource]

    Returns or modifies the rendering material source of an object.
    Rendering materials are stored in Rhino's rendering material table.  This table is conceptually an array.  Render materials associated with objects and layers are specified by zero based indices into this array.
    The index of the render material used to render an object is specified in one of three ways:
    1. Material from layer.  The rendering material assigned to the layer is used.
    2. Material from object.  The rendering material assigned to the object is used.
    3. Material from parent.  For objects with parents, like objects in block instances, use parent's material. If no parent, treats as material from layer.
    The default rendering material source for new objects is "material by layer."

[Syntax]

    Rhino.ObjectMaterialSource (strObject [, intSource])
    Rhino.ObjectMaterialSource (arrObjects , intSource)

[Parameters]

    strObject
    Required.  String.  The identifier of the object.
    arrObjects
    Required.  Array.  An array of strings identifying the objects to modify.
    intSource
    Optional.  Number.  The new rendering material source.  If omitted, the current material source is returned.  Note, if arrObjects is specified, intSource is required.
    Value
    Description
    0
    Material from layer
    1
    Material from object
    2
    <unused>
    3
    Material from parent

[Returns]

    Number
    If a rendering material source is not specified,  the current rendering material source if successful.
    Number
    If a rendering material source is specified, the previous rendering material source if successful.
    Number
    If arrObjects is specified, then the number of objects modified if successful.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Dim arrObjects, strObject, lngColor
    arrObjects = Rhino.GetObjects("Select objects to reset rendering material source")
    If IsArray(arrObjects) Then
    For Each strObject In arrObjects
    Rhino.ObjectMaterialSource strObject, 0
    Next
    End If
