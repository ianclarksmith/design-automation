[ObjectPrintWidthSource]

    Returns or modifies the print width source of an object.  The width used to print objects is specified in one of three ways:
    1. Print width from layer.  Use the print width assigned to the object's layer.
    2. Print width from object.  Use the print width that is assigned to the object.
    3. Print width from parent.  For objects with parents, like objects in block instances, use parent's print width.  If no parent, treats as print width from layer.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.ObjectPrintWidthSource (strObject [, intSource])
    Rhino.ObjectPrintWidthSource (arrObjects, intSource)

[Parameters]

    strObject
    Required.  String.  The identifier of the object.
    arrObjects
    Required.  Array.  An array of strings identifying the objects to modify.
    intSource
    Optional.  Number.  The new print width source.  If omitted, the current print width source is returned.  Note, if arrObjects is specified, intSource is required.
    Value
    Description
    0
    Print width by layer.
    1
    Print width by object.
    2
    <unused>
    3
    Print width by parent.

[Returns]

    Number
    If a print width source is not specified,  the current width source if successful.
    Number
    If a print width source is specified, the previous width source if successful.
    Number
    If arrObjects is specified, then the number of objects modified if successful.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Dim arrObjects, strObject
    arrObjects = Rhino.GetObjects("Select objects to reset print width source")
    If IsArray(arrObjects) Then
    For Each strObject In arrObjects
    Rhino.ObjectPrintWidthSource strObject, 0
    Next
    End If
