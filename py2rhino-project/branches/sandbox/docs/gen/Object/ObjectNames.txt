    Dim arrObjects, arrNames, strName, i
    arrObjects = Rhino.GetObjects("Select objects")
    If IsArray(arrObjects) Then
    arrNames = Rhino.ObjectNames(arrObjects)
    If IsArray(arrNames) Then
    For i = 0 to UBound(arrObjects)
    strName = arrNames(i)
    If IsNull(strName) Then strName = "<none>"
    Rhino.Print arrObjects(i) & " = " & strName
    Next
