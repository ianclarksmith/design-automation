[ScaleObjects]

    Scales one or more objects. This function can be used to perform uniform or non-uniform scale transformations. Scaling is based on the active construction plane.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.ScaleObjects (arrObjects, arrOrigin, arrScale [, blnCopy])

[Parameters]

    arrObjects
    Required. Array. An array of strings identifying the objects to scale.
    arrOrigin
    Required. Array. The origin of the scale transformation.
    arrScale
    Required. Array. An array of three numbers that identify the X axis, Y axis, and Z axis scale factors to apply. Scaling is based on the active construction plane.
    blnCopy
    Optional. Boolean. Copy the objects. If omitted, the objects will not be copied (False).

[Returns]

    Array
    An array of strings identifying the scaled objects if successful.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Dim arrObjects, arrOrigin
    arrObjects = Rhino.GetObjects("Select objects to scale")
    If IsArray(arrObjects) Then
    arrOrigin = Rhino.GetPoint("Origin point")
    If IsArray(arrOrigin) Then
    Rhino.ScaleObjects arrObjects, arrOrigin, array(2,2,2), True
    End If
    End If
