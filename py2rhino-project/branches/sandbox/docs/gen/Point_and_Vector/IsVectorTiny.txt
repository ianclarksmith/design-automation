[IsVectorTiny]

    Verifies that a vector is very short, or tiny - the x,y,z  elements are less than or equal to 1.0e-12.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.IsVectorTiny (arrVector)

[Parameters]

    arrVector
    Required.  Array.  The 3-D vector to test.

[Returns]

    Boolean
    True if the vector is tiny, otherwise False, if successful.
    Null
    On error.

[Example]

    Dim arrPt1, arrPt2, arrVector
    arrPt1 = Rhino.GetPoint("First point")
    arrPt2 = Rhino.GetPoint("Next point")
    arrVector = Rhino.VectorCreate(arrPt2, arrPt1)
    If Rhino.IsVectorTiny(arrVector) Then
    Rhino.Print "The vector is tiny."
    Else
    Rhino.Print "The vector is not tiny."
    End If
