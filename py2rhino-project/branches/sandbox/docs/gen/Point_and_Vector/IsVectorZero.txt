[IsVectorZero]

    Verifies that a vector is zero, or tiny - the  x,y,z elements are equal to 0.0.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.IsVectorZero (arrVector)

[Parameters]

    arrVector
    Required.  Array.  The 3-D vector to test.

[Returns]

    Boolean
    True if the vector is zero, otherwise False, if successful.
    Null
    On error.

[Example]

    Dim arrPt1, arrPt2, arrVector
    arrPt1 = Rhino.GetPoint("First point")
    arrPt2 = Rhino.GetPoint("Next point")
    arrVector = Rhino.VectorCreate(arrPt2, arrPt1)
    If Rhino.IsVectorZero(arrVector) Then
    Rhino.Print "The vector is zero."
    Else
    Rhino.Print "The vector is not zero."
    End If
