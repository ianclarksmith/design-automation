[VectorCompare]

    Compares two 3-D vectors.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.VectorCompare (arrVector1, arrVector2)

[Parameters]

    arrVector1
    Required.  Array.  The first 3-D vector to compare.
    arrVector2
    Required.  Array.  The second 3-D vector to compare.

[Returns]

    -1
    If arrVector1 is less than arrVector2.
    0
    If arrVector1 is equal to arrVector2.
    1
    If arrVector1 is greater than arrVector2.
    Null
    On error.

[Example]

    Dim arrVector1, arrVector2
    arrVector1 = Array(1,0,0)
    arrVector2 = Array(0,1,0)
    MsgBox Rhino.VectorCompare(arrVector1 , arrVector2)
