[Syntax]

    Rhino.Angle2 (arrLine1, arrLine2)

[Parameters]

    arrPoint1
    Required.  Array.  An array containing the starting and ending 3-D points of the first line.
    arrPoint2
    Required.  Array.  An array containing the starting and ending 3-D points of the second line.

[Returns]

    Array
    An array containing the following elements if successful.
    0
    The angle in degrees.
    1
    The reflex angle in degrees.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Dim arrLine1(1), arrLine2(1), arrAngle
    arrLine1(0) = Rhino.GetPoint("Start of first line")
    arrLine1(1) = Rhino.GetPoint("End of first line", arrLine1(0))
    arrLine2(0) = Rhino.GetPoint("Start of first line")
    arrLine2(1) = Rhino.GetPoint("End of first line", arrLine2(0))
    arrAngle = Rhino.Angle2(arrLine1, arrLine2)
    If IsArray(arrAngle ) Then
    Rhino.Print "Angle: " & CStr(arrAngle(0))
    End If
