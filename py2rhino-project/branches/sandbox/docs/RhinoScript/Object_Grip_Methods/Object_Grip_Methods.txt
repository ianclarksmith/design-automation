Object Grip Methods


Rhino allows the user to point edit curves, surfaces, and polygon meshes. Such points are controlled by objects called grips. Individual grips are accessed by specifying an zero-based index value. Note, before an object's grips can be queried or manipulated, they must be enabled. The following methods are available for querying or manipulating Rhino grip objects.
