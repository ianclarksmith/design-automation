PlanarClosedCurveContainment



PlanarClosedCurveContainment


Determines the relationship between the regions bounded by two coplanar simple closed curves.


Syntax


Rhino.PlanarClosedCurveContainment (strCurve1, strCurve2 [, arrPlane [, dblTolerance]])


Parameters



strCurve1 

Required.  String.  The object identifier of the first planar, closed curve.

strCurve2 

Required.  String.  The object identifier of the second planar, closed curve.

arrPlane 

Optional.  Array. The new construction plane.  If omitted, the currently active construction plane is used.  The elements of a construction plane array are as follows:


Element 

Type 

Description

0 

Array 

Required.  The construction plane's origin (3-D point).

1 

Array 

Required.  The construction plane's X axis direction (3-D vector).

2 

Array 

Required.  The construction plane's Y axis direction (3-D vector).

3 

Array 

Optional.  The construction plane's Z axis direction (3-D vector).


dblTolerance 

Optional.  Number.  The tolerance.  If omitted, the current document absolute tolerance is used.


Returns



Number 

A number identifying the relationship if successful.  The possible values are as follows:


Value 

Description

0 

The regions bounded by the curves are disjoint.

1 

The two curves intersect.

2 

The region bounded by strCurve1 is inside of strCurve2.

3 

The region bounded by strCurve2 is inside of strCurve1.  


Null 

If not successful, or on error.


Example


Const rhObjectCurve = 4

Dim strCurve1, strCurve2, intResult

strCurve1 = Rhino.GetObject("Select first curve", rhObjectCurve )

strCurve2 = Rhino.GetObject("Select second curve", rhObjectCurve )

If Rhino.IsCurvePlanar(strCurve1) And Rhino.IsCurvePlanar(strCurve2) Then

If Rhino.IsCurveClosed(strCurve1) And Rhino.IsCurveClosed(strCurve2) Then

If Rhino.IsCurveInPlane(strCurve1) And Rhino.IsCurveInPlane(strCurve2) Then

intResult = Rhino.PlanarClosedCurveContainment(strCurve1, strCurve2)

If (intResult = 0) Then

Rhino.Print "The regions bounded by the curves are disjoint."

ElseIf (intResult = 1) Then

Rhino.Print "The two curves intersect.."

ElseIf (intResult = 2) Then

Rhino.Print "The region bounded by Curve1 is inside of Curve2."

Else

Rhino.Print "The region bounded by Curve2 is inside of Curve1."
