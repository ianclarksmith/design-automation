SetUserText



SetUserText


Sets or removes user text stored on an object. For more details on User Text, see the discussion found in the User Data Methods summary.


Syntax


Rhino.SetUserText (strObject, strKey [, strValue [, blnAttachToGeometry]])


Parameters



strObject 

Required.  String.  The object's identifier.

strKey 

Required.  String.  The key name to set.

strValue 

Optional.  String.  The string value to set. If omitted the key/value pair specified by strKey will be deleted.

blnAttachToGeometry 

Optional.  Boolean.  The location on the object to store the User Text.


Value 

Description

True 

Attaches text information to the object geometry. If the information is closely associated with the geometry, attach it to the geometry. For example, a circle's radius should be attached to the geometry because the information will be invalid if the circle is control-point edited and changed into a NURBS curve.

False (Default) 

Attaches text information to the attributes of an object. If the information is higher-level attribute information, like color, then it should be attached to the object's attributes. Attribute information will persist when an object is control point edited, trimmed, copied, and so on.



Returns



Boolean 

True or False indicating success or failure.

Null 

If not successful, or on error.


Example


Dim strObject

strObject = Rhino.GetObject("Select object")

If VarType(strObject) = vbString Then

  Rhino.SetUserText strObject, "PartNo", "KM40-4960"

  Rhino.SetUserText strObject, "Price", "1.25"

End If
