ObjectPrintColorSource



ObjectPrintColorSource


Returns or modifies the print color source of an object.  The color used to print objects is specified in one of four ways:

1. Print color from layer.  Use the print color assigned to the object's layer.

2. Print color from object.  Use the print color that is assigned to the object.

3. Print color from display.  Use the object's display color.

4. Print color from parent.  For objects with parents, like objects in block instances, use parent's print color.  If no parent, treats as print color from layer.
