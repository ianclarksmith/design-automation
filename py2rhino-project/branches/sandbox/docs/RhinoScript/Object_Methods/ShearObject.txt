ShearObject



ShearObject


Performs a shear transformation on a single object. Transformation is based on the active construction plane.


Syntax


Rhino.ShearObject (strObject, arrOrigin, arrRefPt, dblAngle [, blnCopy])


Parameters



strObject 

Required. String. The identifier of the object to shear.

arrOrigin 

Required. Array. The origin of the shear transformation.

arrRefPt 

Required. Array. The reference point of the shear transformation.

arrScale 

Required. Number. An angle in degrees of the shear transformation, where -90.0 <= angle <= 90.0.

blnCopy 

Optional. Boolean. Copy the object. If omitted, the object will not be copied (False).


Returns



String 

The identifier of the sheared object if successful.

Null 

If not successful, or on error.


Example


Dim strObject, arrOrigin, arrRefPt

strObject = Rhino.GetObject("Select object to shear")

If Not IsNull(strObject) Then

arrOrigin = Rhino.GetPoint("Origin point")

arrRefPt = Rhino.GetPoint("Reference point")

If IsArray(arrOrigin) And IsArray(arrRefPt) Then

Rhino.ShearObject strObject, arrOrigin, arrRefpt, 45.0, True

End If

End If
