Layer State Methods


Rhino's LayerStateManager command allows you to save the states of layers and restore them at a later time.  The layer state command is implemented in the Rhino Bonus Tools plug-in, or RhinoBonusTools.rhp. Because the LayerStateManager command resides in a plug-in, you will first need to get the plug-in's scriptable object, using GetPlugInObject, before you can call any of these methods.

For example:



Sub TestLayerStates

  Dim objPlugIn

  On Error Resume Next

  Set objPlugIn = Rhino.GetPluginObject("Rhino Bonus Tools")

  If Err Then

    MsgBox Err.Description

    Exit Sub

  End If

  'TODO: call a layer state method...

End Sub
