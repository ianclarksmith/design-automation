[IsVectorParallelTo]

    Compares two vectors to see if they are parallel.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.IsVectorParallelTo (arrVector1, arrVector2)

[Parameters]

    arrVector1
    Required.  Array.  The 3-D vector.
    arrVector2
    Required.  Array.  The 3-D vector to compare to.

[Returns]

    Number
    The result of the comparison if successful. The possible results are as follows:
    Value
    Description
    -1
    The vectors are anti-parallel.
    0
    The vectors are not parallel.
    1
    The vectors are parallel.
    Null
    On error.

[Example]

    Dim arrVector1, arrVector2
    arrVector1 = Array(1,0,0)
    arrVector2 = Array(0,1,0)
    MsgBox Rhino.IsVectorParallelTo arrVector1, arrVector2
