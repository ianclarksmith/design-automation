[SortPointList]

    Sorts an array of 3-D points so they will be connected in "reasonable" polyline order.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.SortPointList (arrPoints [, dblTolerance])

[Parameters]

    arrPoints
    Required.  Array.  An array of 3-D points.
    dblTolerance
    Optional.  Number.  The minimum distance between points.  Points that fall within this tolerance will be discarded.  If omitted, Rhino's internal zero tolerance is used.

[Returns]

    Array
    An array of sorted 3-D points  if successful.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Dim arrPoints, arrSorted
    arrPoints = Rhino.GetPointCoordinates
    If IsArray(arrPoints) Then
    arrSorted = Rhino.SortPointList(arrPoints)
    Rhino.AddPolyline arrSorted
    End If
