[ShearObjects]

    Performs a shear transformation on one or more objects. Transformation is based on the active construction plane.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.ShearObjects (arrObjects, arrOrigin, arrRefPt, dblAngle [, blnCopy])

[Parameters]

    arrObjects
    Required. Array. An array of strings identifying the objects to shear.
    arrOrigin
    Required. Array. The origin of the shear transformation.
    arrRefPt
    Required. Array. The reference point of the shear transformation.
    arrScale
    Required. Number. An angle in degrees of the shear transformation, where -90.0 <= angle <= 90.0.
    blnCopy
    Optional. Boolean. Copy the objects. If omitted, the objects will not be copied (False).

[Returns]

    Array
    An array of strings identifying the scaled objects if successful.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Dim arrObjects, arrOrigin, arrRefPt
    arrObjects = Rhino.GetObjects("Select objects to shear")
    If IsArray(arrObjects) Then
    arrOrigin = Rhino.GetPoint("Origin point")
    arrRefPt = Rhino.GetPoint("Reference point")
    If IsArray(arrOrigin) And IsArray(arrRefPt) Then
    Rhino.ShearObjects arrObjects, arrOrigin, arrRefpt, 45.0, True
    End If
    End If
