[ObjectLinetypeSource]

    Returns or modifies the linetype source of an object.   The linetype used to display objects is specified in one of three ways:
    1. Linetype from layer.  The object's layer determines the object's linetype.
    2. Linetype from object. The object's linetype is set by the object itself.
    3. Linetype from parent.  For objects with parents, like objects in block instances, use parent's linetype. If no parent, treats as linetype from layer.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.ObjectLinetypeSource (strObject [, intSource])
    Rhino.ObjectLinetypeSource (arrObjects, intSource)

[Parameters]

    strObject
    Required.  String.  The identifier of the object.
    arrObjects
    Required.  Array.  An array of strings identifying the objects to modify.
    intSource
    Optional.  Number.  The new linetype source.  If omitted, the current linetype source is returned.  Note, if arrObjects is specified, intSource is required.
    Value
    Description
    0
    Layer.  Use the object's layer linetype.
    1
    Object.  Use the object's linetype.
    2
    <unused>
    3
    Parent.  Use the parent object's linetype.

[Returns]

    Number
    If a linetype source is not specified,  the current linetype source if successful.
    Number
    If a linetype source is specified, the previous linetype source if successful.
    Number
    If arrObjects is specified, then the number of objects modified if successful.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Dim arrObjects, strObject, lngColor
    arrObjects = Rhino.GetObjects("Select objects to reset linetype source")
    If IsArray(arrObjects) Then
    For Each strObject In arrObjects
    Rhino.ObjectLinetypeSource strObject, 0
    Next
    End If
