[OrientObject]

    Orients a single object based on input points.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.OrientObject (strObject, arrReference, arrTarget [, intFlags])

[Parameters]

    strObject
    Required.  String.  The identifier of the object to orient.
    arrReference
    Required.  Array.  An array of 3-D reference points.  If two 3-D points are specified, then this method will function similar to Rhino's Orient command.  If more than two 3-D points are specified, then the function will orient similar to Rhino's Orient3Pt command.
    arrTarget
    Required.  Array.  An array of 3-D target points.  If two 3-D points are specified, then this method will function similar to Rhino's Orient command.  If more than two 3-D points are specified, then the function will orient similar to Rhino's Orient3Pt command.
    intFlags
    Optional.  Number.  The orient flags.  Values can be added together to specify multiple options.
    Value
    Description
    1
    Copy object.  The default is not to copy the object.
    2
    Scale object.  The default is not to scale the object.  Note, the scale option only applies if both arrReference and arrTarget contain only two 3-D points.

[Returns]

    String
    The identifier of the oriented object if successful.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Dim strObject, arrReference, arrTarget
    strObject = Rhino.GetObject("Select object to orient")
    If Not IsNull(strObject) Then
    arrReference = Rhino.GetPoints(,,"First reference point")
    If IsArray(arrReference) And (UBound(arrReference) > 0) Then
    arrTarget = Rhino.GetPoints(,,"First target point")
    If IsArray(arrTarget) And (UBound(arrTarget) > 0) Then
    Rhino.OrientObject strObject, arrReference, arrTarget
    End If
    End If
    End If
