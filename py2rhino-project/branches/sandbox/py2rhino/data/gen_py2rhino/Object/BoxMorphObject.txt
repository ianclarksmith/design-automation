[BoxMorphObject]

    Morphs an object by mapping its eight bounding box points to eight new points. Note, this function only works on non-planar objects.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.BoxMorphObject (strObject, arrBoxPoints [, blnCopy])
    Rhino.BoxMorphObject (arrObjects, arrBoxPoints [, blnCopy])

[Parameters]

    strObject
    Required. String. The identifier of the object to morph.
    arrObjects
    Required.  Array.  An array of strings identifying the objects to morph.
    arrBoxPoints
    Required. Array.  An array of eight 3-D points that contain the modified bounding box points.
    blnCopy
    Optional. Boolean. Copy the object. If omitted, the object will not be copied (False).

[Returns]

    String
    The identifier of the morphed object if successful.
    Array
    An array of strings identifying the morphed objects if successful.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Dim strObject, arrBox, arrPoint
    strObject = Rhino.GetObject("Select object to box morph")
    If Not IsNull(strObject) Then
    arrBox = Rhino.BoundingBox(strObject)
    arrPoint = arrBox(6)
    arrPoint(2) = arrPoint(2) * 2
    arrBox(6) = arrPoint
    Rhino.BoxMorphObject strObject, arrBox
    End If
