[ObjectColorSource]

    Returns or modifies the color source of an object.   The color used to display objects is specified in one of four ways:
    1. Color from layer.  The object's layer determines the object's color.
    2. Color from object.  The object's color is set by the object itself.
    3. Color from material.  The object's diffuse material color determines the object's color.
    4. Color from parent. For objects with parents, like objects in block instances, use parent's color source. If no parent, treats as color from layer.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.ObjectColorSource (strObject [, intSource])
    Rhino.ObjectColorSource (arrObjects, intSource)

[Parameters]

    strObject
    Required.  String.  The identifier of the object.
    arrObjects
    Required.  Array.  An array of strings identifying the objects to modify.
    intSource
    Optional.  Number.  The new color source.  If omitted, the current color source is returned.  Note, if arrObjects is specified, intSource is required.
