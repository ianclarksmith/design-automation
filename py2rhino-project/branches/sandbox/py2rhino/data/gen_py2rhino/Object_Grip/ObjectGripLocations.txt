[ObjectGripLocations]

    Returns or modifies the location of all grips owned by an object. The locations of the grips are returned in an array of 3-D points with each position in the array corresponding to that grip's index. To modify the locations of grips, you must provide an array of 3-D points that contains the same number of points at grips.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.ObjectGripLocations (strObject [, arrPoints])

[Parameters]

    strObject
    Required.  String.  The identifier of the object.
    arrPoints
    Optional.  Array.  An array of 3-D points identifying the new locations of the grips.

[Returns]

    Array
    If arrPoints is not specified, the current location of all grips if successful.
    Array
    If arrPoints is specified, the previous location of all grips if successful.
    Null

    Dim strObject, arrPoints, arrPt
    strObject = Rhino.GetObject("Select curve", 4)
    If Not IsNull(strObject) Then
    Rhino.EnableObjectGrips strObject
    arrPoints = Rhino.ObjectGripLocations(strObject)
    For Each arrPt in arrPoints
    Rhino.Print Rhino.Pt2Str(arrPt)
    Next
    End If
