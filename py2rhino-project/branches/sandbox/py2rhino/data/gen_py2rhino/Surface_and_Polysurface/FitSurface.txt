[FitSurface]

    Reduces the number of surface control points while maintaining the surfaces' same general shape.  Use this function for replacing surface with too many control points.  For more information, see the Rhino help file for the FitSrf command.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.FitSurface (strObject [, arrDegree [, dblTolerance]])

[Parameters]

    strObject
    Required.  String.  The object's identifier.
    arrDegree
    Optional.  Array.  An array of two numbers that identify the surface curve degree in both the U and the V directions. Each degree value must be greater than 1. The default is 3.
    dblTolerance
    Optional.  Number.  The fitting tolerance.  If dblTolerance is not specified or <= 0.0, the document absolute tolerance is used.

[Returns]

    String
    The identifier of the new object if successful.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Const rhSurface = 8
    Dim strOldSrf, strNewSrf
    strOldSrf = Rhino.GetObject("Select surface to fit", rhSurface)
    If Not IsNull(strOldSrf) Then
    strNewSrf = Rhino.FitSurface(strOldSrf)
    If Not IsNull(strNewSrf) Then
    Rhino.DeleteObject strOldSrf
    End If
    End If
