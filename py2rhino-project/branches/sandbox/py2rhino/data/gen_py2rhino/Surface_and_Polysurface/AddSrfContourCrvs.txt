[AddSrfContourCrvs]

    Adds a spaced series of planar curves resulting from the intersection of a defined cutting planes through a surface or a polysurface. For more information, see the Rhino help file for details on the Contour command.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.AddSrfContourCrvs (strObject, arrStartPoint, arrEndPoint [, dblInterval])
    Rhino.AddSrfContourCrvs (strObject, arrPlane [, dblInterval])

[Parameters]

    strObject
    Required.  String.  The identifier of a surface or polysurface object.
    arrStartPoint
    Required.  Array.  The 3-D starting point of a center line.
    arrEndPoint
    Required.  Array.  The 3-D ending point of a center line.
    arrPlane
    Required.  Array.  A plane that defines the cutting plane.
    dblInterval
    Optional.  Number.  The distance between contour curves.  If omitted, the interval will be equal to the diagonal distance of the object's bounding box divided by 50.

[Returns]

    Array
    An array of strings identifying the newly created contour curves if successful.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Const rhObjectSurface = 8
    Const rhObjectPolysurface = 16
    Dim strObject, arrStartPoint, arrEndPoint
    strObject = Rhino.GetObject("Select object", rhObjectSurface + rhObjectPolysurface)
    arrStartPoint = Rhino.GetPoint("Base point of center line")
    arrEndPoint = Rhino.GetPoint("Endpoint of center line", arrStartPoint)
    Rhino.AddSrfContourCrvs strObject, arrStartPoint, arrEndPoint
