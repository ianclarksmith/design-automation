[LastCreatedObjects]

    Returns the identifiers of the objects that were most recently created or changed by scripting a Rhino command using the Command function.  It is important to call this function immediately after calling the Command function as only the most recently created or changed object identifiers will be returned.

    Rhino.LastCreatedObjects ([blnSelect])

[Parameters]

    blnSelect
    Optional.  Boolean.  Select the object.  If omitted, the object is not selected (False).

[Returns]

    Array
    An array of strings identifying the most recently created or changed objects if successful.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Dim arrObjects, strObject
    Rhino.Command "_-Circle 0,0,0 10"
    Rhino.Command "_-Circle 10,0,0 10"
    Rhino.Command "_-Circle 20,0,0 10"
    arrObjects = Rhino.LastCreatedObjects
    If IsArray(arrObjects) Then
    ' Only the last circle will be selected
    Rhino.SelectObjects arrObjects
    End If
