    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Dim arrObject
    arrObject = Rhino.GetObjectEx("Select object", 0, True)
    If IsArray(arrObject) Then
    Rhino.Print "Object id = " & arrObject(0)
    Rhino.Print "Object was preselected = " & CStr(arrObject(1))
    Select Case arrObject(2)
    Case 0
    Rhino.Print "Selection method = 0 (non-mouse)"
    Case 1
    Rhino.Print "Selection method = 1 (mouse)"
    Rhino.Print "Pick point = " & Rhino.Pt2Str(arrObject(3))
    Case 2
    Rhino.Print "Selection method = 1 (window)"
    Case 3
    Rhino.Print "Selection method = 1 (crossing)"
    End Select
