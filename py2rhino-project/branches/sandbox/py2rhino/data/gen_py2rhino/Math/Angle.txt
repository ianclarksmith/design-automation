[Angle]

    Measures the angle between two points.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.Angle (arrPoint1, arrPoint2 [, blnWorld])

[Parameters]

    arrPoint1
    Required.  Array.  The first 3-D point.
    arrPoint2
    Required.  Array.  The second 3-D point.
    blnWorld
    Optional.  Boolean.  If True, the angle calculation is based on the world coordinate system.  If False, the angle calculation is based on the active construction plane.  The default value is True.

[Returns]

    Array
    An array containing the following elements if successful.
    0
    The X,Y angle in degrees.
    1
    The elevation.
    2
    The  delta in the X direction.
    3
    The  delta in the Y direction.
    4
    The  delta in the Z direction.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Dim arrPoint1, arrPoint2, arrAngle
    arrPoint1 = Rhino.GetPoint("First point")
    If IsArray(arrPoint1) Then
    arrPoint2 = Rhino.GetPoint("Second point")
    If IsArray(arrPoint2) Then
    arrAngle = Rhino.Angle(arrPoint1, arrPoint2)
    If IsArray(arrAngle) Then
    Rhino.Print "Angle: " & CStr(arrAngle(0))
    End If
    End If
    End If
