[ATan2]

    Returns the angle whose tangent is the quotient of two specified numbers.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.ATan2 (dblNumberY, dblNumberX)

[Parameters]

    dblNumberY
    Required.  Number.  The y coordinate of a point.
    dblNumberX
    Required.  Number.  The x coordinate of a point.

[Returns]

    Number
    An angle, ?, measured in radians, such that -PI = ? = PI, and Tan(?) = y / x, where (x, y) is a point in the Cartesian plane.
    Observe the following:
    For (x, y) in quadrant 1, 0 < ? < PI/2.
    For (x, y) in quadrant 2, PI/2 < ? = PI.
    For (x, y) in quadrant 3, -PI < ? < -PI/2.
    For (x, y) in quadrant 4, -PI/2 < ? < 0.
    The return value is the angle in the Cartesian plane formed by the x-axis, and a vector starting from the origin, (0, 0), and terminating at the point, (x, y).
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.
