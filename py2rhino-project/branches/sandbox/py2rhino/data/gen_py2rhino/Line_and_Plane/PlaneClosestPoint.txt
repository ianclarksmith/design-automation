[PlaneClosestPoint]

    Returns the point on a plane that is closest to a test point.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.PlaneClosestPoint (arrPlane, arrPoint [, blnReturnPoint])

[Parameters]

    arrPlane
    Required.  Array.  The plane. The elements of a plane array are as follows:
    Element
    Description
    0
    Required.  The plane's origin (3-D point).
    1
    Required.  The plane's X axis direction (3-D vector).
    2
    Required.  The plane's Y axis direction (3-D vector).
    3
    Optional.  The plane's Z axis direction (3-D vector).
    arrPoint
    Required.  Array.  The 3-D point to test.
    blnReturnPoint
    Optional.  Boolean.  If omitted or True, then the point on the plane that is closest to the test point is returned. If False, then the parameter of the point on the plane that is closest to the test point is returned.

[Returns]

    Array
    If blnReturnPoint is omitted or True, then the 3-D point if successful. If blnReturnPoint is False, then an array containing the U,V parameters of the point if successful.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Dim arrPlane, arrPoint
    arrPoint = Rhino.GetPoint("Point to test")
    If IsArray(arrPoint) Then
    arrPlane = Rhino.ViewCPlane
    If IsArray(arrPlane) Then
    MsgBox Rhino.Pt2Str(Rhino.PlaneClosestPoint(arrPlane, arrPoint))
    End If
    End If
