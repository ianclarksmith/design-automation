[RotatePlane]

    Rotates a plane.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.RotatePlane (arrPlane, dblAngle, arrAxis)

[Parameters]

    arrPlane
    Required.  Array.  The plane.  The elements of a plane array are as follows:
    Element
    Description
    0
    Required.  The plane's origin (3-D point).
    1
    Required.  The plane's X axis direction (3-D vector).
    2
    Required.  The plane's Y axis direction (3-D vector).
    3
    Optional.  The plane's Z axis direction (3-D vector).
    dblAngle
    Required.  Number.  The rotation angle in degrees.
    arrAxis
    Required.  Array.  A non-zero 3-D vector identifying the axis of rotation.

[Returns]

    Array
    The plane if successful.  The elements of a plane array are as follows:
    Element
    Description
    0
    The plane's origin (3-D point).
    1
    The plane's X axis direction (3-D vector).
    2
    The plane's Y axis direction (3-D vector).
    3
    The plane's Z axis direction (3-D vector).
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Dim arrPlane, arrRotated
    arrPlane = ViewCPlane
    arrRotated = RotatePlane(arrPlane, 45.0, arrPlane(1))
    Rhino.ViewCPlane , arrRotated
