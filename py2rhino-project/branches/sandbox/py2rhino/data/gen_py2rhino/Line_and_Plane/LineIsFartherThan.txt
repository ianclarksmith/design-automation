[LineIsFartherThan]

    Determines if the shortest distance from a line to a point or another line is greater than a specified distance.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.LineIsFartherThan (arrLine, dblDistance, arrPoint)
    Rhino.LineIsFartherThan (arrLine, dblDistance, arrLine2)

[Parameters]

    arrLine
    Required.  Array.  Two 3-D points identifying the starting and ending points of the line.
    dblDistance
    Required.  Number.  The distance.
    arrPoint
    Required.  Array.  The test point.
    arrLine2
    Required.  Array.  Two 3-D points identifying the starting and ending points of the test line.

[Returns]

    Boolean
    True if the shortest distance from the line to the other object is greater than dblDistance, False otherwise.
    Null
    On error.

[Example]

    Dim arrFrom, arrTo, arrPoint, arrResult
    arrFrom = Array(0, 0, 0)
    arrTo = Array(10, 10, 0)
    arrPoint = Array(10, 5, 0)
    MsgBox Rhino.LineIsFartherThan(Array(arrFrom, arrTo), 3, arrPoint)
