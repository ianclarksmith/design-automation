[Parameters]

    strView
    Optional.  String.  The title or identifier of the view.  If omitted, the current active view is used.
    arrPlane
    Optional.  Array. The new construction plane.  The elements of a plane array are as follows:
    Element
    Description
    0
    Required.  The construction plane's origin (3-D point).
    1
    Required.  The construction plane's X axis direction (3-D vector).
    2
    Required.  The construction plane's Y axis direction (3-D vector).
    3
    Optional.  The construction plane's Z axis direction (3-D vector).

[Returns]

    Array
    If a construction plane is not specified, the current construction plane if successful.
    Array
    If a construction plane is specified, the previous construction plane if successful.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Dim arrPlane(3)
    arrPlane(0) = Array(0,0,0)
    arrPlane(1) = Array(1,0,0)
    arrPlane(2) = Array(0,1,0)
    arrPlane(3) = Array(0,0,1)
    strView = Rhino.CurrentView
    Rhino.ViewCPlane strView, arrPlane
