[OffsetCurveOnSurface]

    Offset a curve on a surface.  The source curve must lie on the surface. The offset curve or curves will be added to Rhino.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.OffsetCurveOnSurface (strCurve, strSurface, dblDistance)
    Rhino.OffsetCurveOnSurface (strCurve, strSurface, arrParameter)

[Parameters]

    strCurve
    Required.  String.  The curve object's identifier. Note, the curve must lie on the surface.
    strSurface
    Required.  String.  The surface object's identifier.
    dblDistance
    Requried.  Number.  The distance of the offset.  Based on the curve's direction, a possitive value will offset to the left and a negative value will offset to the right.
    arrParameter
    Requried.  Array.  An array containing the surface U,V parameter that the curve will be offset through.

[Returns]

    Array
    An array containing the identifiers of the new curve objects if successful.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Sub TestOffsetCurveOnSurface
    Const rhCurve = 4
    Const rhSurface = 8
    Dim strCurve, strSurface, arrPoint, arrParameter
    strCurve = Rhino.GetObject("Select curve on a surface", rhCurve)
    If IsNull(strCurve) Then Exit Sub
    strSurface = Rhino.GetObject("Select base surface", rhSurface)
    If IsNull(strCurve) Then Exit Sub
    arrPoint = Rhino.GetPointOnSurface(strSurface, "Through point")
    If IsNull(arrPoint) Then Exit Sub
    arrParameter = Rhino.SurfaceClosestPoint(strSurface, arrPoint)
    Rhino.offsetcurveonsurface strCurve, strSurface, arrParameter
    End Sub
