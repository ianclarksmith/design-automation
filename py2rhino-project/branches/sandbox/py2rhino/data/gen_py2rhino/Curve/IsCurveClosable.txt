[IsCurveClosable]

    Decide if it makes sense to close off the curve by moving  the endpoint to the start based on start-end gap size and length of curve as approximated by chord defined by 6 points.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.IsCurveClosable (strObject [, dblTolerance])

[Parameters]

    strObject
    Required.  String.  The object's identifier.
    dblTolerance
    Optional. Number.  The maximum allowable distance between start point and end point of the curve.  If omitted, the document's current absolute tolerance is used.

[Returns]

    Boolean
    True if successful, otherwise False.
    Null
    On error.

[Example]

    Const rhObjectCurve = 4
    Dim strObject
    strObject = Rhino.GetObject("Select curve", rhObjectCurve)
    If Not Rhino.IsCurveClosed(strObject) And Rhino.IsCurveClosable(strObject) Then
    Rhino.CloseCurve strObject
    End If
