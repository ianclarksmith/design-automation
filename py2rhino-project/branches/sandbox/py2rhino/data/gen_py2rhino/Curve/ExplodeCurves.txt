[ExplodeCurves]

    Explodes, or un-joins,  one more curve objects.  Polycurves will be exploded into curve segments.  Polylines will be exploded into line segments.  ExplodeCurves will return the curves in
    topological order.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.ExplodeCurves (strObject [, blnDelete])
    Rhino.ExplodeCurves (arrObjects [, blnDelete])

[Parameters]

    strObject
    Required.  String.  The identifier of the curve object to explode.
    arrObjects
    Required.  Array.   An array of strings identifying the curve objects to explode.
    blnDelete
    Optional.  Boolean.  Delete input objects after exploding.  The default is not to delete objects (False).

[Returns]

    Array
    An array of strings identifying the newly created curve objects if successful.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Const rhObjectCurve = 4
    Dim strObject
    strObject = Rhino.GetObject("Select curve to explode", rhObjectCurve)
    If Rhino.IsCurve(strObject) Then
    Rhino.ExplodeCurves strObject
    End If
