[SplitCurve]

    Splits, or divides, a curve at a specified parameter. The parameter must be in the interior of the curve's domain.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.SplitCurve (strObject, dblParameter [, blnDelete])
    Rhino.SplitCurve (strObject, arrParameters [, blnDelete])

[Parameters]

    strObject
    Required.  String.  The object's identifier.
    dblParameter
    Required.  Number.  The parameter, to split the curve at, that is in the interval returned by CurveDomain.
    arrParameters
    Required.  Array.  An array of one or more parameters, to split the curve at, that are in the interval returned by CurveDomain.
    blnDelete
    Optional.  Boolean.  Delete the input curve. The default is to delete the input curve (True).

[Returns]

    Array
    An array containing the identifiers of the two newly created curve objects, if successful.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Const rhCurveObject = 4
    Dim strObject, arrDomain, dblParameter
    strObject = Rhino.GetObject("Select a curve to split", rhCurveObject)
    If Rhino.IsCurve(strObject) Then
    arrDomain = Rhino.CurveDomain(strObject)
    dblParameter = arrDomain(1) / 2
    Rhino.SplitCurve strObject, dblParameter
    End If
