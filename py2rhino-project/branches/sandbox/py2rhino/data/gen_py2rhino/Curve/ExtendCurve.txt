[ExtendCurve]

    Extends a non-closed curve object by a line, arc, or smooth extension until it intersects a collection of objects.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.ExtendCurve (strObject, intType, intSide, arrObjects)

[Parameters]

    strObject
    Required.  String.  The object's identifier.
    intType
    Required.  Number.  Type of extension.
    Value
    Description
    0
    Line - Creates an line extension tangent to the original curve.
    1
    Arc - Creates an arc extension tangent to the original curve.
    2
    Smooth - Creates a smooth curve extension curvature continuous with the original curve.
    intSide
    Required.  Number.  The size to  extent.
    Value
    Description
    0
    Extend from the start of the curve.
    1
    Extend from the end of the curve.
    arrObjects
    Required.  Array.  The identifiers of curve, surface, and polysurface objects that will be used as boundary objects.

[Returns]

    String
    The identifier of the extended object if successful.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Const rhObjectCurve = 4
    Const rhObjectSurface = 8
    Const rhObjectPolySurface = 16
    Dim arrObjects, strCurve, intObjType
    intObjType = rhObjectCurve + rhObjectSurface + rhObjectPolysurface
    arrObjects = Rhino.GetObjects("Select boundary objects", intObjType)
    If IsArray(arrObjects) Then
    strCurve = Rhino.GetObject("Select curve to extend", rhObjectCurve)
    If Not IsNull(strCurve) Then
    Rhino.ExtendCurve strCurve, 2, 1, arrObjects
    End If
    End If
