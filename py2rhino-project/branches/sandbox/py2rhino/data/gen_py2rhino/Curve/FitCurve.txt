[FitCurve]

    Reduces the number of curve control points while maintaining the curve's same general shape.  Use this function for replacing curves with too many control points.  For more information, see the Rhino help file for the FitCrv command.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.FitCurve (strObject [, intDegree [, dblTolerance [, dblAngleTolerance]]])

[Parameters]

    strObject
    Required.  String.  The object's identifier.
    intDegree
    Optional.  Number.  The curve degree, which must be greater than 1. The default is 3.
    dblTolerance
    Optional.  Number.  The fitting tolerance.  If dblTolerance is not specified or <= 0.0, the document absolute tolerance is used.
    dblAngleTolerance
    Optional.  Number.  The kink smoothing tolerance in degrees.  If dblAngleTolerance is 0.0, all kinks are smoothed.  If dblAngleTolerance is > 0.0, kinks smaller than dblAngleTolerance are smoothed.  If dblAngleTolerance is not specified or < 0.0, the document angle tolerance is used for the kink smoothing.

[Returns]

    String
    The identifier of the new object if successful.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Const rhCurve = 4
    Dim strOldCurve, strNewCurve
    strOldCurve = Rhino.GetObject("Select curve to fit", rhCurve)
    If Not IsNull(strOldCurve) Then
    strNewCurve = Rhino.FitCurve(strOldCurve)
    If Not IsNull(strNewCurve) Then
    Rhino.DeleteObject strOldCurve
    End If
    End If
