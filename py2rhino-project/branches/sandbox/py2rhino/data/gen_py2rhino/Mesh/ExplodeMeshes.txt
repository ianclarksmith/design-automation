[ExplodeMeshes]

    Explodes a mesh object, or mesh objects,  into submeshes.  A submesh is a collection of mesh faces that are contained within a closed loop of unwelded mesh edges.  Unwelded mesh edges are edges where the mesh faces that share the edge have unique mesh vertices (not mesh topology vertices) at both ends of the edge.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.ExplodeMeshes (strObject [, blnDelete])
    Rhino.ExplodeMeshes (arrObjects [, blnDelete])

[Parameters]

    strObject
    Required.  String.  The identifier of the mesh object to explode.
    arrObjects
    Required.  Array.   An array of strings identifying the mesh objects to explode.
    blnDelete
    Optional.  Boolean.  Delete input objects after exploding.  The default is not to delete objects (False).

[Returns]

    Array
    An array of strings identifying the newly created mesh objects if successful.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Const rhObjectMesh = 32
    Dim strObject
    strObject = Rhino.GetObject("Select mesh to explode", rhObjectMesh)
    If Rhino.IsMesh(strObject) Then
    Rhino.ExplodeMeshes strObject
    End If
