[MeshVertexNormals]

    Returns the vertex unit normal for each vertex of a mesh object.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.MeshVertexNormals (strObject)

[Parameters]

    strObject
    Required.  String.  The identifier of a mesh object.

[Returns]

    Array
    An array of 3-D vectors that define the vertex unit normals of the mesh if successful.  The number of elements in the array will be equal to the value returned by MeshVertexCount. In which case, the array will identify the unit normals for each vertex return by MeshVertices.
    Null
    If the mesh does not contain vertex normals, if not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Const rhObjectMesh = 32
    Dim strObject, arrNormals, arrVector
    strObject = Rhino.GetObject("Select mesh", rhObjectMesh)
    arrNormals = Rhino.MeshVertexNormals(strObject)
    If IsArray(arrNormals) Then
    For Each arrVector in arrNormals
    Rhino.Print CStr(arrVector(0)) & "," & CStr(arrVector(1)) & "," & CStr(arrVector(2))
    Next
    End If
