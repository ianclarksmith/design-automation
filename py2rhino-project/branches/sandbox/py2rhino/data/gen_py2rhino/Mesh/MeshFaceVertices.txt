[MeshFaceVertices]

    Returns the vertex indices of all faces of a mesh object.

[Syntax]

    Rhino.MeshFaceVertices (strObject)

[Parameters]

    strObject
    Required.  String.  The identifier of a mesh object.

[Returns]

    Array
    An array containing arrays of four numbers that define the vertex indices for each face of the mesh if successful.  Both quad and triangle faces are returned. If the third and forth vertex indices of a face are identical, the face is a triangle. Otherwise the face is a quad.
    Null
    If not successful, or on error.

[Example]

    Const rhObjectMesh = 32
    Dim strObject, arrFaceVertices, arrFace
    Dim intCount, strText
    strObject = Rhino.GetObject("Select mesh", rhObjectMesh)
    arrFaceVertices = Rhino.MeshFaceVertices( strObject )
    If IsArray(arrFaceVertices) Then
    intCount = 0
    For Each arrFace In arrFaceVertices
    strText = "face(" & CStr(intCount) & ") = ("
    strText = strText & CStr(arrFace(0)) & ","
    strText = strText & CStr(arrFace(1)) & ","
    strText = strText & CStr(arrFace(2)) & ","
    strText = strText & CStr(arrFace(3)) & ")"
    Rhino.Print strText
    intCount = intCount + 1
    Next
    End If
