IsBrepManifold


Verifies a polysurface object is manifold.  A polysurface for which every edge is shared by at most two faces is called a manifold.  If a polysurface has at least one edge that is shared by more than two faces, then that polysurface is called non-manifold.


Syntax


Rhino.IsBrepManifold (strObject)


Parameters



strObject 

Required.  String.  The object's identifier.


Returns



Boolean 

True if successful, otherwise False.

Null 

On error.


Example


Const rhPolysrf = 16

Dim strObject

strObject = Rhino.GetObject("Select a polysurface", rhPolysrf)

If Rhino.IsBrepManifold(strObject) Then

Rhino.Print "The polysurface is manifold."

Else

Rhino.Print "The polysurface is non-manifold."

End If
