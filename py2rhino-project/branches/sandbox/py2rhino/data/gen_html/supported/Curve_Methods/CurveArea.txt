CurveArea



CurveArea


Returns that area of closed planar curves. The results are based on the current drawing units.


Syntax


Rhino.CurveArea (strObject)

Rhino.CurveArea (arrObjects)


Parameters



strObject 

Required.  String.  The identifier of a closed, planar curve object.

arrObjects 

Required.  Array.  An array of strings containing the identifiers of one or more closed, planar curve objects.


Returns



Array 

An array of area information if successful.  The array will contain the following information:


Element 

Type 

Description

0 

Number 

The area. If more than one curve was specified, the value will be the cumulative area.

1 

Number 

The absolute (+/-) error bound for the area.


Null 

If not successful, or on error.


Example


Const rhObjectCurve = 4

Dim strObject, arrMP

strObject = Rhino.GetObject("Select a curve", rhObjectCurve)

If Not IsNull(strObject) Then

arrMP = Rhino.CurveArea(strObject)

If IsArray(arrMP) Then

Rhino.Print "The curve area is: " & CStr(arrMP(0))

End If

End If
