TrimCurve



TrimCurve


Trims a curve by removing portions of the curve outside the specified interval.


Syntax


Rhino.TrimCurve (strObject , arrInterval [, blnDelete])


Parameters



strObject 

Required.  String.  The object's identifier.

arrInterval 

Required.  Array.  An array of two number identifying the interval to keep. Portions of the curve before domain(0) and after domain(1) will be removed. If the input curve is open, the interval must be increasing. If the input curve is closed and the interval is decreasing, then the portion of the curve across the start and end of the curve is returned.

blnDelete 

Optional. Boolean. Delete the input curve. The default is to delete the input curve (True).


Returns



String 

The identifier of the newly created curve object, if successful.

Null 

If not successful, or on error.


Example


Const rhCurveObject = 4

Dim strObject, arrDomain, dblParameter

strObject = Rhino.GetObject("Select a curve to trim", rhCurveObject)

If Rhino.IsCurve(strObject) Then

arrDomain = Rhino.CurveDomain(strObject)

arrDomain(1) = arrDomain(1) / 2

Rhino.TrimCurve strObject, arrDomain

End If
