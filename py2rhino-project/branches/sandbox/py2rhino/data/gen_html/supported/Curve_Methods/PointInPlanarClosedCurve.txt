PointInPlanarClosedCurve



PointInPlanarClosedCurve


Determines if a point is inside of a closed curve, on  a closed curve, or outside of a closed curve.


Syntax


Rhino.PointInPlanarClosedCurve (arrPoint, strCurve [, arrPlane [, dblTolerance]])


Parameters



arrPoint 

Required.  Array.  A 3-D point to test.

strCurve 

Required.  String.  The object identifier of the planar, closed curve.

arrPlane 

Optional.  Array. The new construction plane.  If omitted, the currently active construction plane is used.  The elements of a construction plane array are as follows:


Element 

Type 

Description

0 

Array 

Required.  The construction plane's origin (3-D point).

1 

Array 

Required.  The construction plane's X axis direction (3-D vector).

2 

Array 

Required.  The construction plane's Y axis direction (3-D vector).

3 

Array 

Optional.  The construction plane's Z axis direction (3-D vector).


dblTolerance 

Optional.  Number.  The tolerance.  If omitted, the current document absolute tolerance is used.


Returns



Number 

A number identifying the result if successful.  The possible values are as follows:


Value 

Description

0 

The point is outside of the closed curve.

1 

The point is inside of the closed curve.

2 

The point is on the closed curve.


Null 

If not successful, or on error.


Example


Const rhObjectCurve = 4

Dim strObject, arrPoint, intResult

strObject = Rhino.GetObject("Select a planar, closed curve", rhObjectCurve)

If Rhino.IsCurveClosed(strObject) And Rhino.IsCurvePlanar(strObject) Then

arrPoint = Rhino.GetPoint("Pick a point")

If IsArray(arrPoint) Then

intResult = Rhino.PointInPlanarClosedCurve(arrPoint, strObject)

If (intResult = 0) Then

Rhino.Print "The point is outside of the closed curve."

ElseIf (intResult = 1) Then

Rhino.Print "The point is inside of the closed curve."

Else

Rhino.Print "The point is on the closed curve."

End If

End If

End If
