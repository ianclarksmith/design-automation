SynchronizeCPlanes



SynchronizeCPlanes


Synchronizes all views and their construction plane to that of a specified view's construction plane. 

Normally, changing a view's construction plane is unique to that view.  This method changes the construction planes and normal views of all views to be of a right-angle orientation based on a specified view's construction plane.  This save the effort of changing all views independently, and maintains a standard right-angle view arrangement.

The view synchronization only applies to Rhino's standard-named, parallel-projected views (e.g. Back, Bottom, Front, Left, Right, and Top).  All other views (e.g. Perspective, etc) simply have their construction plane synchronized to that of the specified view's construction plane.
