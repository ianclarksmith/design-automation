Welcome to Design Automation. The aim of this project is to support interoperability between design applications through compatible APIs rather than through file exchange. Python wrappers are being create for a range of design applications, such as CAD software and simulation programs. This will allow users to write Python scripts that can access the functionality of these applications, and to exchange data between these applications.
